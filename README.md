👋 Hi there!
👨🏾‍💻 About Me

Hello there — my name is Frank Harerimana.

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer, Engineering Leader, and Tech Founder based in Kigali, Rwanda.

I started my career in software engineering with a strong foundation in backend systems and scalable web applications. Over the years, I’ve grown into a multidisciplinary engineer with experience across:

Fintech

Digital payments

AWS cloud systems

Mobile applications

USSD platforms

Enterprise software

Beyond engineering, I’ve built and led teams — serving as a Software Engineering Team Lead at BK Techouse and founding:

Landon Fitness Gym

Nuru Labs

I combine technology, operations, and product thinking to drive real-world impact.

What excites me most about software is solving meaningful problems — whether that’s enabling farmers with digital tools, helping schools receive instant payments, or architecting cloud systems that scale.
