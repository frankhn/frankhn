Hello there, My name is Frank Harerimana

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer, Engineering Leader, and Tech Founder based in Kigali, Rwanda.

I started my career in software engineering with a strong foundation in backend systems and scalable web applications. Over the years, I’ve grown into a multidisciplinary engineer with experience across fintech, digital payments, AWS cloud systems, mobile apps, USSD platforms, and enterprise software.

Beyond engineering, I’ve also built and led teams — serving as a Software Engineering Team Lead at BK Techouse and founding both Landon Fitness Gym and Nuru Labs, where I combine technology, operations, and product thinking to drive real-world impact.

What excites me most about software is solving meaningful problems — whether that’s enabling farmers with digital tools, helping schools receive instant payments, or architecting cloud systems that scale.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
Scaling digital platforms across fintech and fitness ecosystems, optimizing backend architectures for performance and reliability, and integrating technology into real-world businesses (including gym management systems, access control, and digital membership platforms). I’m also refining cloud-native deployment strategies and improving CI/CD workflows for production-ready applications.


🌱 I’m currently learning:
Deepening my expertise in advanced mobile application architecture and high-performance backend engineering.


🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Expanding my network within the Nova Scotia and broader Canadian tech ecosystem, connecting with engineering leaders, and exploring opportunities where I can contribute at a senior or lead level.


💬 Ask me about:
Backend architecture with Node.js or .NET, AWS serverless systems, USSD platforms, mobile app lifecycle management, engineering team leadership, or building technology-driven businesses from scratch.

🛠️ My Tech Stack
Frontend: React, SCSS, React Router
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQL, MySQL,
Other: REST APIs, Git/Github, Python, React Native

⚡ Fun fact:
I combine software engineering with entrepreneurship — I run a fitness gym while architecting backend systems. I believe discipline in fitness and discipline in engineering follow the same principle: consistency compounds.
